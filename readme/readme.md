Domain: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Problem Statement:  
VidyAI++ – A Multilingual AI Tutoring & Mentorship Platform Tailored for BPL Government School Students

Use Case:
How can we leverage AI to provide tailored, multilingual academic support to students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) backgrounds in government schools? The challenge encompasses addressing low-connectivity environments and limited digital literacy levels.



Abstract: Bridging Education Gaps with VidyAI++  
VidyAI++ stands as a transformative educational platform, harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence to uplift BPL students in Indian government schools. In alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP), VidyAI++ is designed to break barriers of inclusivity and accessibility. By integrating real-time AI adaptation, emotional intelligence, and multilingual capabilities, the platform ensures personalized learning experiences for all.

Core Features:
1. Adaptive Lesson Delivery:
   Leveraging generative AI via Gemini API, VidyAI++ generates region-specific, classroom-ready content, quizzes, and exercises in native Indian languages, both textually and vocally.

2. Emotion-Aware Teaching:
   By utilizing DeepFace and OpenCV technologies, VidyAI++ detects student emotions, tracks eye movements, and monitors fatigue levels through webcam inputs, dynamically adjusting lesson complexity and pacing to match students’ needs.

3. Learning Styles Customization:
   Catering to individual learning preferences (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic), VidyAI++ delivers tailored teaching formats through advanced classification mechanisms.

4. Human Mentorship:
   An ML-driven mentor-matching engine pairs students with regional and emotionally compatible mentors for effective, human-guided academic support.

Offline-First Approach:
Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), VidyAI++ employs TensorFlow Lite and IndexedDB storage to maintain functionality even in low- or no-internet scenarios.

Barrier-Free Interface:
With voice-driven commands and an intuitive icon-based UI, VidyAI++ ensures accessibility for digitally illiterate students and guardians alike.
