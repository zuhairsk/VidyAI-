“VidyAI++ – Multilingual AI Tutoring & Mentorship Platform for BPL 
Government School Students” 
 Objective: 
Design and develop an AI-powered, multilingual, and inclusive web platform to 
provide personalized education, mentorship, and learning support to 
underprivileged (BPL) students enrolled in government schools across India. The 
system should align with the National Education Policy (NEP) and offer dynamic, 
interactive, and accessible learning experiences using cutting-edge AI 
technologies. 
Problem Description: 
VidyAI++ should function as an all-in-one academic assistant that adapts to each 
student's learning style, regional language, and educational background. It must 
integrate: 
 Multilingual Generative AI Tutoring using Gemini/GPT to produce localized 
content and quizzes in Indian languages (both text and speech-based) 
tailored to each student's class level and regional syllabus. 
 Real-Time Adaptive Content Delivery that detects the student’s learning 
difficulty using AI, adjusts lesson complexity using reinforcement learning, 
and offers custom interventions like explainer videos or alternate 
problem-solving techniques. 
 Vision-Based Learning Level Estimation by employing webcam-based 
emotion detection, eye tracking, and fatigue analysis (via OpenCV + 
DeepFace). The system should autonomously adapt teaching pace and 
raise alerts for disengagement or cognitive overload. 
 AI Mentor Matchmaking System that intelligently pairs students with local 
or virtual mentors (volunteers/NGOs) using an ML-based model 
considering emotional state, subject needs, availability, and regional 
compatibility. 
 Persona Intelligence Engine to classify students into visual, auditory, or 
kinesthetic learners, and dynamically modify the teaching format and 
lesson structure accordingly. 
 Gamified Learning Experience with skill heatmaps, micro-certifications, 
digital badges, and streak-based motivation mechanics to improve 
engagement and retention. 
 Offline-First Architecture to ensure functionality in low-bandwidth or no
internet zones using PWA and TensorFlow Lite for edge AI inference. 
 Zero Literacy Barrier Interface with voice-based navigation, large visual 
cues, and automatic translation/transcription for students and parents 
with limited reading skills.


also add login page with that also add chat bot for user friendly purpose 
the interface can be converted into dark nd white theme 
with some glitters
also connect to database to add video lectures in the lessons for the grades 1 to 12 
also use NLP 
nd there should be few videos which can be linked through youtube
there should be quizzes nd all which are linked with data base 
nd there should be the actual quiz 
nd it should be Multilingual text-to-speech for improved accessibility

so with all this build this  

add more videos to the subjects
nd add in my courses add subjects related to the particular grade
nd also gather the best videos
so that user can select accordingly the best one
also with that remove mentors section
nd also in language when we are selecting a particular language the whole page should be converted into the particular text
in quizzes add some quizzes to solve
nd show achievements
with that also develop the profile section
settings
help and support
the interface should be interactive and attractive 
change the theme
to white nd make it more stylish nd good looking and fix the bugs

with that make sure that database is connected to internet so that users can easily access the videos without hesitation
with that also add TTS
as it should understand our questions while we ask
nd make sure the voice assistant nd read aloud is working
also show the progress

make all this changes

add more subjects like
social studies
history
geography
civics
economics
nd native languages like hindi, telugu, tamil, marathi, etc
add videos according to that from database
use some bright colors for the UI/UX interface
make it simple, cool
here
Or continue with
add google, twitter, facebook
add few pictures in login page
nd in login nd signup the boxes are not accurate make sure its accurate
in Recommended Courses
also add few materials like pdf so that users can understand easily

nd in Your Progress
add more subjects

I'm unable to get the courses
its showing like this
